Problem statement
You have been given a text message. You have to return the Run-length Encoding of the given message.

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as the character and a single count. For example, the string "aaaabbbccdaa" would be encoded as "a4b3c2d1a2".

Sol: import java.util.* ;
import java.io.*; 
public class Solution {
    public static String encode(String message) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int count = 1;
        
        // Iterate through the characters of the input string
        for (int i = 0; i < message.length(); i++) {
            // Check if the current character is the same as the next character
            if (i < message.length() - 1 && message.charAt(i) == message.charAt(i + 1)) {
                // If yes, increment the count
                count++;
            } else {
                // If no, append the character and its count to the result
                sb.append(message.charAt(i)).append(count);
                // Reset the count for the next group
                count = 1;
            }
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
